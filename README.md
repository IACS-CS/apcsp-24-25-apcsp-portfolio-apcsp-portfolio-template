# Portfolio Project

Welcome to the Portfolio Project.

This is an example of a modern website, using what is called a "static site generator" which is
a JavaScript system that generates a webpage that can be hosted easily.


## Installing Your First Library

To show you how we go about installing modern components, we're going to use
node package manager to install a simple style library called picocss.

```sh
npm install @picocss/pico
```

Once this is done, we will have picocss in our node_modules.
